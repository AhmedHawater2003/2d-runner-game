## Features
- **Space Theme**: Immersive alien player model and galactic background.
- **Health, Score & Time**: Track your health visually with a health bar, score points by collecting items, and race against the clock.
- **Responsive Controls**: Jump and duck to avoid obstacles with intuitive keyboard controls.
- **Sound Effects**: Background music and unique sound effects for different actions.
- **Animated Collectibles & Power-Ups**: Engaging animations for objects with varying effects on gameplay.

## Controls
- **Jump**: `Space` or `W` key
- **Duck**: `S` key

## Gameplay Elements
### Obstacles
Obstacles of varying heights appear from the right side of the screen, challenging players to jump or duck. Colliding with an obstacle reduces health.

### Collectibles
Collectibles are placed throughout the course. Each collectible increases the score upon collision and disappears after being collected.

### Power-Ups
Two types of power-ups offer temporary boosts with visual and sound effects, adding a strategic element to the gameplay.

## Technical Details
- **Language**: C++
- **Framework**: OpenGL
- **Graphics**: Custom alien character and items designed with OpenGL primitives.
- **Animations**: Dynamic animations for collectibles and background.
- **Sound**: Custom sound effects for game actions (collect, collide, win, and loss) and continuous background music.
- **Game Logic**: Progressive difficulty scaling with increasing game speed, health depletion on collision, and timed game end.

## Setup & Installation
